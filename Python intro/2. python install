Python Install:
However, if you want to run Python on your own computer, follow the instructions below.

Many Windows PCs and Mac computers already have Python pre-installed.

To check if Python is installed on Windows, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

C:\Users\Your Name>python --version
To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:

python --version

If Python is not installed on your computer, you can download it for free from the official website: https://www.python.org/

Python Quickstart:
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

Let's write our first Python file, called hello.py, which can be done in any text editor:

hello.py:

print("Hello, World!")

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

C:\Users\Your Name>python hello.py
The output should be:

Hello, World!
Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.

Python Version:
To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the sys module:

Example
Check the Python version of the editor:

import sys

print(sys.version)

The Python Command Line:
To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:

C:\Users\Your Name>python
Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":
C:\Users\Your Name>py

From there you can write any python code, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:

C:\Users\Your Name>python
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:

C:\Users\Your Name>python
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:

exit()
